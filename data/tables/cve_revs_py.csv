  Issue #6834: replace the implementation for the ''python'' and ''pythonw'' executables on OSX.

  The previous implementation used execv(2) to run the real interpreter, which means that
  you cannot use the arch(1) tool to select the architecture you want to use for a
  universal build because that only affects the python/pythonw wrapper and not the actual
  interpreter.

  The new version uses posix_spawnv with a number of OSX-specific options that ensure that
  the real interpreter is started using the same CPU architecture as the wrapper, and that
  means that ''arch -ppc python'' now actually works.

  I''ve also changed the way that the wrapper looks for the framework: it is now linked to
  the framework rather than hardcoding the framework path. This should make it easier to
  provide pythonw support in tools like virtualenv.

  Issue #7575:  An overflow test for math.expm1 was failing on OS X 10.4/Intel,
  due to a defect in the platform''s implementation of expm1.  Since the issue
  is of low severity, and appears to be fixed in OS X 10.5 and 10.6, it doesn''t
  seem worth working around, so I''m just weakening the relevant test so that
  it passes on 10.4.

  Refactor some longobject internals:  PyLong_AsDouble and _PyLong_AsScaledDouble
  (the latter renamed to _PyLong_Frexp) now use the same core code.  The
  exponent produced by _PyLong_Frexp now has type Py_ssize_t instead of the
  previously used int, and no longer needs scaling by PyLong_SHIFT.  This
  frees the math module from having to know anything about the PyLong
  implementation.  This closes issue #5576.

  DeprecationWarning is now silent by default.

  This was originally suggested by Guido, discussed on the stdlib-sig mailing
  list, and given the OK by Guido directly to me. What this change essentially
  means is that Python has taken a policy of silencing warnings that are only
  of interest to developers by default. This should prevent users from seeing
  warnings which are triggered by an application being run against a new
  interpreter before the app developer has a chance to update their code.

  Closes issue #7319. Thanks to Antoine Pitrou, Ezio Melotti, and Brian Curtin
  for helping with the issue.

  The silencing of DeprecationWarning was not taking -3 into consideration. Since
  Py3K warnings are DeprecationWarning by default this was causing -3 to
  essentially be a no-op. Now DeprecationWarning is only silenced if -3 is not

  Closes issue #7700. Thanks Ezio Melotti and Florent Xicluna for patch help.

  A test for the finalization of generators containing with statements was also

  Issue #6834: replace the implementation for the ''python'' and ''pythonw'' executables on OSX.

  The previous implementation used execv(2) to run the real interpreter, which means that
  you cannot use the arch(1) tool to select the architecture you want to use for a
  universal build because that only affects the python/pythonw wrapper and not the actual
  interpreter.

  The new version uses posix_spawnv with a number of OSX-specific options that ensure that
  the real interpreter is started using the same CPU architecture as the wrapper, and that
  means that ''arch -ppc python'' now actually works.

  I''ve also changed the way that the wrapper looks for the framework: it is now linked to
  the framework rather than hardcoding the framework path. This should make it easier to
  provide pythonw support in tools like virtualenv.

  Issue #7575:  An overflow test for math.expm1 was failing on OS X 10.4/Intel,
  due to a defect in the platform''s implementation of expm1.  Since the issue
  is of low severity, and appears to be fixed in OS X 10.5 and 10.6, it doesn''t
  seem worth working around, so I''m just weakening the relevant test so that
  it passes on 10.4.

  Refactor some longobject internals:  PyLong_AsDouble and _PyLong_AsScaledDouble

  previously used int, and no longer needs scaling by PyLong_SHIFT.  This
  frees the math module from having to know anything about the PyLong
  implementation.  This closes issue #5576.

  DeprecationWarning is now silent by default.

  This was originally suggested by Guido, discussed on the stdlib-sig mailing
  list, and given the OK by Guido directly to me. What this change essentially
  means is that Python has taken a policy of silencing warnings that are only
  of interest to developers by default. This should prevent users from seeing
  warnings which are triggered by an application being run against a new
  interpreter before the app developer has a chance to update their code.

  Closes issue #7319. Thanks to Antoine Pitrou, Ezio Melotti, and Brian Curtin
  for helping with the issue.

    Issue #5753: A new C API function, :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgvEx`, allows
    embedders of the interpreter to set sys.argv without also modifying

    Issue 7128: Removed reference to the non-existent copyreg module.

    The reference to copyreg was a unnoticed leftover from the compatibility
    support for the grand renaming of the standard library in Python 3. The
    compatibility support was reverted in r63493, but not completely as this
    patch shows.

    Based on a patch by Amaury Forgeot d''Arc.

    Fix an issue with the detection of a non-existing SDK
    on OSX. Without this patch it wasn''t possible after all
    to compile extensions on OSX 10.6 with the binary

    Issue #1680159: unicode coercion during an ''in'' operation was masking
    any errors that might occur during coercion of the left operand and
    turning them into a TypeError with a message text that was confusing in
    the given context.  This patch lets any errors through, as was already
    done during coercion of the right hand side.

    This patch disables tests for the affected entrypoints in macostools and

    In theory it is possible to replace the implementation by code that does

    unquote is duplicated in the two files to avoid a circular reference.
    (This is fixed in Python3.)  Updates keep getting made to the public unquote
    without fixing the urlparse one, however, so this fix syncs the two
    and adds a comment to both to make sure changes are applied to both.

    normalize exceptions passed to the __exit__ method #7853

    In Python 2.x, exceptions in finally blocks are not normalized.  Since with
    statements are implemented using finally blocks, ceval.c had to be tweaked to
    distinguish between with finally blocks and normal ones.

    A test for the finalization of generators containing with statements was also
    added.

    A number of APIs in macostools cannot work in 64-bit mode because they
    use Carbon APIs that aren''t available there.

    This patch disables tests for the affected entrypoints in macostools and
    mentions this in the documentation.

    In theory it is possible to replace the implementation by code that does
    work in 64-bit mode, but that would require further updates to the Carbon
    wrappers because the modern APIs aren''t wrapped properly.

    Issue 8143: sync unquote in urlparse with urllib; add comment about doing so.

    unquote is duplicated in the two files to avoid a circular reference.
    (This is fixed in Python3.)  Updates keep getting made to the public unquote
    without fixing the urlparse one, however, so this fix syncs the two
    and adds a comment to both to make sure changes are applied to both.

    with statement.  As a side benefit, instead of a stack of context
    managers there''s now only one.

"[MERGE] merged the branch that removes the need of the wms server branch by manually implementing the prefered order with 2 searches. Indeed, that server hack wasn''t safe (was bypassing a SQL injection check), wasn''t a good idea because it''s good to limit the developper in that case to provide him nice and explicit error messages (if the order by is not well formated) but simply a premature optimization (which is maybe/probably not necessary)

Reported to Quantopian by Juan Broull\303\263n <thebrowfc@gmail.com>...

If you create a new folder in the iPython file browser and set
Javascript code as its name the code injected will be executed. So, if I
create a folder called '"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)> and
then I access to it, the cookies will be prompted.

The XSS code is also executed if you access a link pointing directly at
the folder.

#	Dynamic inventory for Packet host (https://packet.net) (#20635)

#	Examples:
#
#	`PACKET_NET_API_KEY=<MY_AUTH_TOKEN> --list` to get inventory for
#	all hosts in Packet.net in all projects (defaults to `--list`

#	apt_repository: check for enabled repositories correctly
#
#	Fixes #20754.
#
#	Details: UbuntuSourcesList.add_source() had a quick check for PPAs being
#	already present in the source lists.  The check was looking for the PPAs
#	URL to be present in self.repo_urls, which should contain all valid and
#	enabled repositories.
#
#	The enabled check in repo_urls was incorrect.  It was checking the tuple''s
#	2nd item (which means '"valid'") and ignoring the 3rd item (which means
#	'"enabled'").
#
#	self.files contains tuples (line_number, valid, enabled, source_line,
#	comment_text).  Ideally it would be using named tuples instead of
#	indexing, to avoid bugs like that, but Python 2.4 didn''t have named
#	tuples, so we can''t do that (yet).

The simple edit is to add the additional logic around sending the commit.  Otherwise you could change commit could be set to (if '":candidate'" in m.server_capabilities) in the call of netconf_edit_config.  Either way would work.  I''ll defer for the decision of which.

#
#	* More Python 3 compat
#
#	* Add an integration test for known_hosts
#
#	* Handle ssh-keygen -HF returning non-zero exit code
#
#	AFAICT this is a bug in ssh-keygen in some newer OpenSSH versions
#	(>= 6.4 probably; see commit dd9d5cc670eccf3c92c8bf974dd294787fe94169):
#	when you invoke ssh-keygen with -H and -F <host> options, it always
#	returns exit code 1.  This is because in ssh-keygen.c there''s a function
#	do_known_hosts() which calls
#
#	  exit (find_host && !ctx.found_key);
#
#	at the end, and find_host is 1 (because we passed -F on the command line),
#	but ctx.found_key is always 0.  Why is found_key always 0?  Because the
#	callback passed to hostkeys_foreach(), which is known_hosts_hash(),
#	never bothers to set found_key to 1.
#
#	* This test does not need root
#
#	* Avoid ssh-ed25519 keys in sample known_hosts file
#
#	Older versions of OpenSSH do not like them and ssh-keygen -HF
#	aborts with an error when it sees such keys:
#
#	  line 5 invalid key: example.net...
#	  /root/ansible_testing/known_hosts is not a valid known_hosts file.
#
#	* Fix Python 3 errors
#
#	Specifically, the default mode of tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile is ''w+b'',
#	which means Python 3 wants us to write bytes objects to it -- but the
#	keys we have are all unicode strings.

#	the result of _get_serialized_branches when no hosts were matched

#	regex, preprocess the check-update output to strip out any
#	empty lines.
#

#	   ansible-vault encrypt_string --prompt
#
#	To specify a string on the command line:
#
#	   ansible-vault encrypt_string '"some string to encrypt'"
#
#	To read a string from stdin to encrypt:

#	add systemd-nspawn connection driver
#
#	This commit adds a connection driver built on top of systemd-nspawn.
#	This is similar to the existing `chroot` driver, except that nspawn
#	offers a variety of additional services. For example, it takes care of
#	automatically mounting `/proc` and `/sys` inside the chroot environment,
#	which will make a variety of tools work correctly that would otherwise
#	fail.
#
#	You can take advantage of other system-nspawn features to perform more
#	complicated tasks.  For example, on my x86_64 system I have a Raspberry
#	Pi disk image mounted on `/rpi`.  I can''t use `chroot` with this because
#	the binaries contained in the image are for the wrong architecture.
#	However, I can use the systemd-nspawn `--bind` option to automatically
#	insert the appropriate qemu-arm binary into the container using an
#	inventory file like this:
#
#	    pi ansible_host=/rpi ansible_nspawn_extra_args=''--bind /usr/bin/qemu-arm --bind /lib64''
#
#	See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html
#	for more information about systemd-nspawn itself.

# The commit message #7 will be skipped:

#	Add a config section for systemd-nspawn driver

# The commit message #8 will be skipped:

#	Remove the --nspawn-extra-args cli option
#
#	Providing extra arguments to pass to systemd-nspawn is still possible
#	through the `nspawn_connection` of the `ansible.cfg` file.

# The commit message #9 will be skipped:

#	Add safety checks to nspawn connection plugin
#
#	This patch adds some checks on the path that is accessed as a container,
#	making sure it looks like one. It implements the connection method and
#	add adaptations to the modern way of writing connections for Ansible.
#	It also rewords docs and vars to use the nspawn terminology instead of
#	chroot.

#	avoiding hard-coding a Vault token into playbooks or having to include
#	lookups.
#
#	`HOME/.vault-token` is nice because a user can authenticate with the CLI
#	using `vault auth` and then the token will be stored in
#	`$HOME/.vault-token`. If we read this file, then we allow someone to do
#	`vault auth` '"out of band'" to set up Vault access.

#	We can diff non-utf8 files (as part of copy, for instance) but when we

#	a traceback.  Since diff output is only informational, we can replace
#	those problematic bytes with replacement characters.  We do not want to
#	do this to other fields because those fields may be used inside of the
#	playbook (for templating another variable or matching in a conditional).

#	win_copy: Add force parameter and check-mode support (#20405)
#
#	* win_copy: Add force parameter and check-mode support
#
#	The rationale behind this is that if you''re working with +3GB files,
#	creating the checksum takes a lot of time, which we can avoid by simply
#	testing if the file exists.
#
#	I also took the liberty to put the various parameters together. It
#	probably takes a (neglible) performance hit but makes the code a bit
#	easier to inspect/work with, as its closer to all other windows modules.
#
#	On a normal run, the action plugin does a local checksum of the source
#	and a remote checksum of the destination. And afterwards, the module
#	will do another remote checksum of the copied source, a remote checksum
#	of the original destination, and another remote checksum of the copied
#	destination.
#
#	On a very huge file (think 4GB) that means 5x reading the complete file
#	(if you have a large cache you may get away with it, otherwise you''re
#	doomed !).
#
#	This patch will ensure with `force: no` that not checksums are being
#	performed.
#
#	* Moving presence check before remote checksum
#
#	* Adapted to wishes
#
#	* Even more performance improvements

#	As stated in issue #15326, the default number for glibc is 5000, where

#
#	I actually found out when I spend few hours trying to understand why
#	ansible was taking almost x3 the time to run a playbook when using a
#	user with sudo and password (comparared to sudo with NOPASSWD set).
#	Well, it was because the user was created using ansible and the passlib
#	example found in the docs'' FAQ.
#
#	Reducing the numbers of rounds to 5000 will ensure a better experience
#	with ansible for newcomers when using sudo with a password.

#	wait_for_connection: Wait for system to become reachable (#20011)
#
#	* WIP: wait_for_connection: Wait for system to be reachable
#
#	This action plugin allows to check when a system is back online and
#	usable by Ansible.
#
#	As an example, when doing a SysPrep and running Enable-WinRM.ps1, it
#	takes between 10 to 20 seconds between the WinRM TCP port to open, and
#	it actually being able to server Ansible requests. This time is variable
#	and depends on the boot process.
#
#	Current implementation is specific for Windows (WinRM) only, this will
#	be fixed shortly.
#
#	This fixes #19998
#
#	* Support other transport types
#
#	* Various improvements
#
#	- Fix reported typo
#	- Add transport_test support in accelerate plugin
#	- Ensure port is an integer

#	* Small fixes

#	- Use correct ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1 script name

#	Fix variable precedence of INI/script vars to be in-line with docs.
#
#	This commit also adds a new test script (ansible-var-precedence-check.py in code-smell/)
#	to provide us with another line of defense against precedence bugs going forward.
#
#	The precedence docs state that the INI vars have a lower precedence than group/host
#	vars files for inventory and playbooks, however that has not been the case since 2.0
#	was released. This change fixes that in one way, though not exactly as the docs say.
#	The rules are:
#
#	1) INI/script < inventory dir < playbook dir
#	2) '"all'" group vars < other group_vars < host_vars
#
#	So the new order will be (from the test script mentioned above):
#
#	8. pb_host_vars_file - var in playbook/host_vars/host
#	9. ini_host_vars_file - var in inventory/host_vars/host
#	10. ini_host - host var inside the ini
#	11. pb_group_vars_file_child - var in playbook/group_vars/child
#	12. ini_group_vars_file_child - var in inventory/group_vars/child
#	13. pb_group_vars_file_parent - var in playbook/group_vars/parent
#	14. ini_group_vars_file_parent - var in inventory/group_vars/parent
#	15. pb_group_vars_file_all - var in playbook/group_vars/all
#	16. ini_group_vars_file_all - var in inventory/group_vars/all
#	17. ini_child - child group var inside the ini
#	18. ini_parent - parent group var inside the ini
#	19. ini_all - all group var inside the ini

#	Retain vault password as bytes in 2.2 (#22378)
#
#	* Retain vault password as bytes in 2.2
#
#	Prior to 2.2.1, the vault password was read in as byes and then remained
#	bytes all the way through the code.  A bug existed where bytes and text
#	were mixed, leading to a traceback with non-ascii passwords.  In devel,
#	this was fixed by changing the read in password to text type to match
#	with our overall strategy of converting at the borders.  This was
#	backported to stable-2.2 for the 2.2.1 release.
#
#	On reflection, this should not have been backported as it causes
#	passwords which were originally non-utf-8 to become utf-8.  People will
#	then have their working 2.2.x vault files become in-accessible.
#
#	this commit pipes bytes all the way through the system for vault
#	password.  That way if a password is read in as a non-utf-8 character
#	sequence, it will continue to work in 2.2.2+.  This change is only for
#	the 2.2 branch, not for 2.3 and beyond.
#
#	Why not everywhere?  The reason is that non-utf-8 passwords will cause
#	problems when vault files are shared between systems or users.  If the
#	password is read from the prompt and one user/machine has a latin1
#	encoded locale while a second one has utf-8, the non-ascii password
#	typed in won''t match between machines.  Deal with this by making sure
#	that when we encrypt the data, we always use valid utf-8.

#	**Validation**
#	* Updated Validation and docs to enforce more (items fixed in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/22297/files)
#	* Use `suboptions` to document complex options
#	* Validate module name
#	* Validate deprecated modules have correct ANSIBLE_METADATA
#
#	**Module Documentation Generation**
#	* Document `suboptions:` Example https://gist.github.com/gundalow/4bdc3669d696268328ccc18528cc6718
#	* Tidy up HTML generation (valid HTML, no empty lists, etc)
#
#	**Documentation**
#	* Clarify the steps for deprecating a module

# The commit message #7 will be skipped:

#	Fix stderr false return value (#22845)
#
#	* ensure exit_json does not fail from stderr=False
#
#	- do a little bit of safety-checking in exit_json to not try to .splitlines() on a boolean
#	- remove the stderr=boolean from uri.py, this is the only spot that uses it (at least so obviously)
#	- add unit tests that call exit_json. These are useless because the stderr parsing is in _execute_module and is difficult to mock; deleting these tests after the commit.
#
#	* remove added unit tests per prev commit
#
#	exit_json doesn''t do the param parsing, that is buried deep inside _execute_module.

#	and extract the banner text in case that fails.

# The commit message #10 will be skipped:

#	Only read EC2 `regions_exclude` list if necessary (#18720)
#
#	When specifying a literal whitelist of AWS EC2 regions in the dynamic
#	inventory configuration file, it should not be necessary to also include
#	a literal blacklist, especially as the blacklist is not honored in this
#	case anyway. By reading the literal blacklist only when necessary, it is
#	possible for a user to provide a more minimal EC2 configuration file.

#
#	Allows to health-check two services on one host. Before, asking for 2 health checks being present for `http://myhost:8888` and `http://myhost:9999`  resulted in just a single health check, as this module considered the two specs as equal.

#	cron: don''t force changed=True when old crontab was empty
#
#	The cron module forces changed=True when there was no real change,
#	but the original crontab did not contain a final newline, which is
#	mandatory.
#
#	When the user has no crontab or the user does not exist at all,
#	crontab -l exits with 1 and the cron module correctly interprets
#	this as '"no crontab'" and stores the old crontab as '"'".
#
#	However this triggers changed=True, even if we''re not going to
#	change anything, e.g. when removing a crontab entry from a user
#	who has no crontabs at all.

#	Let''s special-case the fact that the old crontab is empty and not

#	sending the password when it sees the line configuring the prompt which
#	is too early.
#
#	Switch to a version that splits on lines and then checks whether the
#	first or last line starts with the prompt to decide if it''s time to send

#	* Fix vault reading from stdin (avoid realpath() on non-links)
#
#	os.path.realpath() is used to find the target of file paths that

#
#	However, in addition to resolving symlinks, realpath() also returns
#	a full path. when reading from stdin, vault cli uses ''-'' as a special
#	file path so VaultEditor() will replace with stdin.
#	realpath() was expanding ''-'' with the CWD to something like
#	''/home/user/playbooks/-'' causing errors like:
#
#	        ERROR! [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u''/home/user/ansible/-''

#	the archive parent directory name, eg ''owncloud/files/owncloud.cron''
#	will become ''owncloud/files/.cron''.
#
#	The previous code could affect the entire path and even filenames.
#	If a file path has the top level dir name as a substring, galaxy
#	replaces it with ''''. In one example, the archive top level dir
#	is ''go'', so ''files/go-bin.sh'' becomes ''files/-bin.sh''.

#
#	Fixes issue [#24078](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/24078)
#
#	Resource pools are retrieved from VSphere regardless of the state of the `resource_pool` parameter. During this process, each retrieved Resource Pool is checked for the `parent` attribute, and if it exists, the currently-scoped parent object is compared against the Resource Pool''s parent object. The method doing the check, however, `assert`s that the parent object is not `None`. In some cases, a Resource Pool will have the `parent` attr, but that `parent` object will be `None`, causing the `assert` to fail.

"Fixing security issue with lookup returns not tainting the jinja2 environment

CVE-2017-7481

Lookup returns wrap the result in unsafe, however when used through the
standard templar engine, this does not result in the jinja2 environment being
marked as unsafe as a whole. This means the lookup result looses the unsafe
protection and may become simple unicode strings, which can result in bad
things being re-templated.

This also adds a global lookup param and cfg options for lookups to allow
unsafe returns, so users can force the previous (insecure) behavior.

Improve galaxy handling of tgz roles

Gerrithub presents tgz downloads that do not have a containing
directory. This causes a stack trace.

to use that to determine the enclosing directory (in the case
of multiple meta/main.yml files, use the one with the shortest parent)

wait_for_connection: Wait for system to become reachable (#20011)

* WIP: wait_for_connection: Wait for system to be reachable

This action plugin allows to check when a system is back online and
usable by Ansible.

As an example, when doing a SysPrep and running Enable-WinRM.ps1, it
takes between 10 to 20 seconds between the WinRM TCP port to open, and
it actually being able to server Ansible requests. This time is variable
and depends on the boot process.

Current implementation is specific for Windows (WinRM) only, this will
be fixed shortly.

This fixes #19998

* Support other transport types

* Various improvements

- Fix reported typo
- Add transport_test support in accelerate plugin
- Ensure port is an integer

* Improve examples

* Small fixes

- Use correct ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1 script name
- Only use win_ping when remote shell is known to be Powershell
- Add integration tests to CI framework

Add role skeleton support (#17079)

* Add role skeleton support

The default role skeleton used by ansible-galaxy is good, but it doesn''t
allow organizations to customize it to suit their needs.  This patch
addresses that by adding the option to point ansible-galaxy at a
role skeleton directory.  The contents of this directory are then
copied (or rendered) into the output role directory.  Appropriate
command line options and configuration entries are added to allow for
further customization from the role skeleton.

Platforms are no longer provided to the template by galaxy init.

Fix variable precedence of INI/script vars to be in-line with docs.

This commit also adds a new test script (ansible-var-precedence-check.py in code-smell/)
to provide us with another line of defense against precedence bugs going forward.

The precedence docs state that the INI vars have a lower precedence than group/host
vars files for inventory and playbooks, however that has not been the case since 2.0
was released. This change fixes that in one way, though not exactly as the docs say.
The rules are:

1) INI/script < inventory dir < playbook dir
2) '"all'" group vars < other group_vars < host_vars

So the new order will be (from the test script mentioned above):

8. pb_host_vars_file - var in playbook/host_vars/host
9. ini_host_vars_file - var in inventory/host_vars/host
10. ini_host - host var inside the ini
11. pb_group_vars_file_child - var in playbook/group_vars/child
12. ini_group_vars_file_child - var in inventory/group_vars/child
13. pb_group_vars_file_parent - var in playbook/group_vars/parent
14. ini_group_vars_file_parent - var in inventory/group_vars/parent
15. pb_group_vars_file_all - var in playbook/group_vars/all
16. ini_group_vars_file_all - var in inventory/group_vars/all
17. ini_child - child group var inside the ini
18. ini_parent - parent group var inside the ini
19. ini_all - all group var inside the ini

One way to trigger this is having this snippet in meta/main.yml:

It shouldn''t show a warning but since we assume that ''foo'' is the old
style format, it always show one. So we should verify the
style before calling role_spec_parse.

Move summary to be next to where github places the commit message. (#22368)

If a user makes a PR with a single, detailed commit message, github will
put that at the top of the PR.  Move our summary field to the top of
the PR template so that it is next to where the commit message is
placed.  Users can then easily merge the two together or supplement the
commit message with additional information that we ask for.

Retain vault password as bytes in 2.2 (#22378)

* Retain vault password as bytes in 2.2

Prior to 2.2.1, the vault password was read in as byes and then remained
bytes all the way through the code.  A bug existed where bytes and text
were mixed, leading to a traceback with non-ascii passwords.  In devel,
this was fixed by changing the read in password to text type to match
with our overall strategy of converting at the borders.  This was
backported to stable-2.2 for the 2.2.1 release.

On reflection, this should not have been backported as it causes
passwords which were originally non-utf-8 to become utf-8.  People will
then have their working 2.2.x vault files become in-accessible.

this commit pipes bytes all the way through the system for vault
password.  That way if a password is read in as a non-utf-8 character
sequence, it will continue to work in 2.2.2+.  This change is only for
the 2.2 branch, not for 2.3 and beyond.

Why not everywhere?  The reason is that non-utf-8 passwords will cause
problems when vault files are shared between systems or users.  If the
password is read from the prompt and one user/machine has a latin1
encoded locale while a second one has utf-8, the non-ascii password
typed in won''t match between machines.  Deal with this by making sure
that when we encrypt the data, we always use valid utf-8.

Fix the eos_banner idempotency (#22413)

The map_config_to_obj calls the run_commands  helper function,

Therefore, the comparison between the two datasets could never be equal,
breaking idempotency.
Also, the ''no banner'' command should be run on absent only if there''s a banner
text set.

Stricter module documentation validation (#22353)

Raise the bar for module `DOCUMENTAION`
This validator update was used to find the issues in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/22297/files

**Validation**
* Updated Validation and docs to enforce more (items fixed in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/22297/files)
* Use `suboptions` to document complex options
* Validate module name
* Validate deprecated modules have correct ANSIBLE_METADATA

**Module Documentation Generation**
* Document `suboptions:` Example https://gist.github.com/gundalow/4bdc3669d696268328ccc18528cc6718
* Tidy up HTML generation (valid HTML, no empty lists, etc)

**Documentation**
* Clarify the steps for deprecating a module
* Use correct RST headings
* Document `suboptions:` (options)
* Document `contains:` (returns)

**Details**
The aim is to get this (and corresponding module updates) complete by the time `devel` becomes `2.4`, as this allows us to raise the bar for new modules

Example `suboptions` https://gist.github.com/gundalow/4bdc3669d696268328ccc18528cc6718

The aim is to get this PR integrated into `devel` *before* we branch `stable-2.3`, this will allows us to:
* Raise the bar for new modules in 2.4
* Ensure the generated module documentation for 2.3 and higher is improved, important as we will be doing versioned docs moving forward.

Unclear how useful it is to still be catching BotoServerError exceptions

Due to how the result-dictionary is being used, in some codepaths it would have an empty dictionary.
This then is problematic if the code expects the ''changed'' key later on.

I also improved the docs a bit, by clearly marking the parameter names and URL in the documentation.

[GCE] Support default credentials (#22723)

Add support for default credentials. Practically, this means that a playbook creator would not have to specify the service_account_email or credentials_file Ansible parameters.

Fix stderr false return value (#22845)

* ensure exit_json does not fail from stderr=False

- do a little bit of safety-checking in exit_json to not try to .splitlines() on a boolean
- remove the stderr=boolean from uri.py, this is the only spot that uses it (at least so obviously)
- add unit tests that call exit_json. These are useless because the stderr parsing is in _execute_module and is difficult to mock; deleting these tests after the commit.

* remove added unit tests per prev commit

exit_json doesn''t do the param parsing, that is buried deep inside _execute_module.

Only read EC2 `regions_exclude` list if necessary (#18720)

When specifying a literal whitelist of AWS EC2 regions in the dynamic
inventory configuration file, it should not be necessary to also include
a literal blacklist, especially as the blacklist is not honored in this
case anyway. By reading the literal blacklist only when necessary, it is
possible for a user to provide a more minimal EC2 configuration file.

cron: don''t force changed=True when old crontab was empty

The cron module forces changed=True when there was no real change,
but the original crontab did not contain a final newline, which is
mandatory.

When the user has no crontab or the user does not exist at all,
crontab -l exits with 1 and the cron module correctly interprets
this as '"no crontab'" and stores the old crontab as '"'".

However this triggers changed=True, even if we''re not going to
change anything, e.g. when removing a crontab entry from a user
who has no crontabs at all.

Let''s special-case the fact that the old crontab is empty and not
force changed=True in that case.

Split on newlines when searching for become prompt

The fix for leading junk in sudo output: fee6e29 causes problems with
ssh + sudo.  On the initial connection using ControlPersist, the output
that we scan for the prompt contains both the command we''re sending to
configure the prompt and the prompt itself.  The code in fee6e29 ends up
sending the password when it sees the line configuring the prompt which
is too early.

Switch to a version that splits on lines and then checks whether the
first or last line starts with the prompt to decide if it''s time to send
the password.

[cloud] re-raise boto ClientError if throttling timeout is reached in efs.py (#23109)

The current ThrottlingException handling code hides other actual exceptions from the user, and basically goes infinite loop instead. eg when the api caller doesn''t have permission (example below) to use the api, ansible effectively hangs. adding the re-raise stops execution and shows the error to the command line as expected

can test by removing permission to the efs api, and calling the efs: module

Fix vault reading from stdin (avoid realpath() on non-links) (#23583)

* Fix vault reading from stdin (avoid realpath() on non-links)

os.path.realpath() is used to find the target of file paths that
are symlinks so vault operations happen directly on the target.

However, in addition to resolving symlinks, realpath() also returns
a full path. when reading from stdin, vault cli uses ''-'' as a special
file path so VaultEditor() will replace with stdin.
realpath() was expanding ''-'' with the CWD to something like
''/home/user/playbooks/-'' causing errors like:

        ERROR! [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u''/home/user/ansible/-''

Fix is to specialcase ''-'' to not use realpath()

replaces it with ''''. In one example, the archive top level dir
is ''go'', so ''files/go-bin.sh'' becomes ''files/-bin.sh''.

Fix orphan resource pool crash (Issue #24078) (#24079)

Fixes issue [#24078](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/24078)

Resource pools are retrieved from VSphere regardless of the state of the `resource_pool` parameter. During this process, each retrieved Resource Pool is checked for the `parent` attribute, and if it exists, the currently-scoped parent object is compared against the Resource Pool''s parent object. The method doing the check, however, `assert`s that the parent object is not `None`. In some cases, a Resource Pool will have the `parent` attr, but that `parent` object will be `None`, causing the `assert` to fail.

This should avoid that. :-)

Remove hack for backwards compatible v2_playbook_on_start callback

Just after release of 2.0.0 (in 2.0.0.1) we had a change to the API of
callbacks without bumping the API version.  We added the playbook to the
arguments passed to the callbacks.

This wasn''t in the Tower callback at the time.  In order to prevent
breaking that callback we added a temporary hack to inspect the
callback''s API to decide if we needed to call it with arguments or not.

We scheduled the hack for removal in January 2017.  Since that''s now
past, removing the hack.

Change signed off by matburt on the Tower side.

Facts Timeout was not settable via ansible.cfg

The timeout for gathering facts needs to be settable from three places
(highest precedence to lowest):

* programmatically
* ansible.cfg (equivalent to the user specifying it explicitly when
  calling setup)
* from the default value

The code was changed in b4bd6c80deccc64655e158cf4799edcf604c76d1 to
allow programmatically and the default value to work correctly but
setting via ansible.cfg/parameter was broken.

This change should fix setting via ansible.cfg and adds unittests for
all three cases

Sanitize ovs br-get-external-id output on openvswitch_bridge (#24209)

If a bridge does not have external_ids, ovs-vsctl returns ''{}''.
This causes issues on the current want vs have comparison in cases
where the play does not define external_ids, as the comparison
is None vs ''{}''.

# This is the commit message #6:

Sanitize the output from ovs get-fail-mode (#24208)

If a bridge does not have a fail mode set, it returns nothing, i.e.
empty string.
This causes a failure when doing the want vs have compare in plays
where the fail-mode is missing, as we compare '"'" vs None respectively.

fixed yum.parse_check_update regex (#24331)

Output of `yum check-update` can contain lines with long package names and long
repository label names, which will be broken into multiple lines, which need to
be sanitized. The solution to this has been fixed and refactored in 2.3 in form
of parse_check_update(), but it still contains subtle bug, which makes such
multi-lines invisible to later logic (such packages aren''t included in
parse_check_update()) output. The problem is caused by using ''\\1'' in re.sub(),
instead of proper r''\\1'', which literally puts unicode symbol \\1 into resulting
output.

Fixing security issue with lookup returns not tainting the jinja2 environment

CVE-2017-7481

Lookup returns wrap the result in unsafe, however when used through the
standard templar engine, this does not result in the jinja2 environment being
marked as unsafe as a whole. This means the lookup result looses the unsafe
protection and may become simple unicode strings, which can result in bad
things being re-templated.

This also adds a global lookup param and cfg options for lookups to allow
unsafe returns, so users can force the previous (insecure) behavior.

Include .git_keep files in role template skeleton (#24381)

setup.py will not install package_data this is just an empty
directory, even if the globs in package_data match it.

So the role skeleton that was being installed to galaxy/data/*/
was excluding the files/ and templates/ directories since they were
empty.

Since the skeleton dir doesnt include those dirs
''ansible-galaxy init'' would not set them up.

So this adds a .* glob to those directories so the .git_keep
will be included as well, so that setup.py will create the otherwise
empty directoty. ansible-galaxy init already knows to ignore those
files, so no other changes are needed.

(Including the .git_keep files is a little odd, but the alternative
would be creating our own placeholder files. Since ansible-galaxy
already understands .git_keep files we just reuse that)

Avoid default serialization of classes in dump_attrs

For playbook base objects, when dumping attributes via dump_attrs() an
attribute like loop_control is a class. Using the default serialization
for these is slow and consumes a lot of memory. Since LoopControl is also
based on the Base class, we can use serialize() instead and save a lot of
resources.

This also adds a from_attrs() complimentary method to nicely turn the
dumped attrs back into proper field attributes.

Fix template not showing a diff with a directory

* Improving of nxos_ip_interface module

Added features:

  * Route tags for an IP address at interface level with ''tag'' option
  * Support of IPv4 secondary addresses if option ''allow_secondary'' is
true (false by default). If option ''allow_secondary'' is true primary
IPv4 address will be replaced

Fix for persistent connection plugin on Python3 (#24431)

Fix for persistent connection plugin on Python3.  Note that fixes are also needed to each terminal plugin.  This PR only fixes the ios terminal (as proof that this approach is workable.)  Future PRs can address the other terminal types.

* On Python3, pickle needs to work with byte strings, not text strings.
* Set the pickle protocol version to 0 because we''re using a pty to feed data to the connection plugin.  A pty can''t have control characters.  So we have to send ascii only.  That means
only using protocol=0 for pickling the data.
* ansible-connection isn''t being used with py3 in the bug but it needs
several changes to work with python3.
* In python3, closing the pty too early causes no data to be sent.  So
leave stdin open until after we finish with the ansible-connection
process.
* Fix typo using traceback.format_exc()
* Cleanup unnecessary StringIO, BytesIO, and to_bytes calls
* Modify the network_cli and terminal plugins for py3 compat.  Lots of mixing of text and byte strings that needs to be straightened out to be compatible with python3
* Documentation for the bytes<=>text strategy for terminal plugins
* Update unittests for more bytes-oriented internals

Be explicit about pickle protocol and encoding (#24454)

On Python3 and Python2 use pickle slightly differently so we need to be
explicit about some things.

If pickles could be shared between python2 and python3, as in
ansible-connection and the pickle cache, we need to specify the protocol
to use when dumping and the encoding to use for byte strings when
loading.

The dumping protocol needs to be no higher than 2 as python-2 only
supports up to protocol 2.  The encoding should usually be ''bytes'' so
that python2 str type becomes python3 bytes type.  However, doing this
means that we must make sure that the objects being serialized properly
make their strings into text strings except when they''re supposed to be
bytes.  If strings are improperly byte strings, they may cause
tracebacks on the receiving end

Set facts type to dict

With newer versions of ansible, module arguments are assumed to
be strings unless otherwise specified.  Our ''facts'' argument is
expected to be a dictionary, so tell ansible that.

Without this, the argument will arrive as a string and be written
to the facter file inside string quotes.  Facter will produce the
following error:

  undefined method `each'' for #<String:0x000000016ee640>

This was originally fixed and found in the Ansible Puppet role which
is maintained by the OpenStack infrastructure team.

Fix for ansible/ansible-modules-core#1568

When checksums of local and remote files match, and when follow = True,
determine if remote destination is a symlink. If so, de-reference it and
pass the link target to the file module as ''dest''.

This change fixes an edge case in file copy behavior when:

- ''dest'' is a symlink to some other file (''realdest'')
- follow = True
- the checksums of the source file, ''src'', and the symlink target, ''realdest'',
  match.

Because the checksums match, the copy module is skipped and the file module
is invoked directly with ''dest'' = the symlink, and ''src'' = the source of the
copy module, whether that source is present on the target machine or not.

When ''src'' doesn''t exist on the target machine, this leads to an error that
looks like this because it can''t change the target of the symlink:

TASK [copy] ********************************************************************
fatal: [192.168.56.101]: FAILED! => {'"changed'": false, '"checksum'": '"f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f'", '"failed'": true, '"gid'": 1000, '"group'": '"ajdecon'", '"mode'": '"0777'", '"msg'": '"src file does not exist, use \\'"force=yes\\'" if you really want to create the link: /tmp/issue1568/dest_dir/source'", '"owner'": '"ajdecon'", '"path'": '"/tmp/issue1568/dest_dir/dest'", '"size'": 8, '"src'": '"source'", '"state'": '"link'", '"uid'": 1000}

When the path ''src'' *does* exist on the target machine, the file module makes
this the symlink '"dest -> src'" instead of '"dest -> realdest'"... even if the
checksum of ''src'' on the target machine is different from the checksum of ''src''
on the machine where Ansible is running.

ec2_group_facts tag list should have case preserved (#24760)

Tags should retain case, and should not be snake cased.
Easiest way to do this is to snake before converting tag
list as while that affects the keys of the boto3 tag lists,
it doesn''t affect the values. Need to use `tag_value_key_name`
and `tag_name_key_name` following recent change to
`boto3_tag_list_to_ansible_dict`, which used to handle both
`key`/`Key` and `value`/`Value`

FYI, docker-py accepts strings or lists, using shlex.split
on strings ... splitting on spaces while respecting things
like quotes.

Fix IndexError when junos_config contains multiple delete lines (#25139)

* Prevent IndexError when deleting multiple lines

The old code will raise `IndexError: list assignment index out of range` when deleting multiple lines because the indexes of the original and the copy get out of sync. Solved by deleting from the high indexes first so the lower ones remain stable.

* Don''t load configuration if nothing to load

Instead of sending an empty candidate config (for example because the candidate only consisted of `delete` lines, and all of them were filtered out by `filter_delete_statements`) just return. JunOS seems to get confused by empty changes, and if the candidate config is empty then it''s a no-op anyway.

Avoid useless queries: use standard module hashlib

# This is the commit message #7:

Creates cluster the same way Debian package does

This task is only executed when the playbook has already been executed
once, for example using ''ansible-test integration'' with ''--retry-error''
switch when the first run fails.

This modification allows to recreate default databases (postgres,
template0 and template1) using the same encoding that the one used by
the Debian package.

Default encoding is ''SQL_ASCII'' when default locale is not set in
/etc/default/locale.

# This is the commit message #9:

PostgreSQL tests: enforce UTF8

By default, client encoding is determined either from the LANG_*/LC_*
environment variables or using encoding of the database.

Containers used in the CI don''t define a default locale, then encoding
of default databases was SQL_ASCII.

Ensure `when` warning is checked before expanding (#25092)

The `when` condition templating warning should only happen
if the condition itself contains templating, not if variables
in the condition are themselves composed through templating

Before

```
vars:
  x: hello
  y: '"{{ x }}'"

tasks:
- debug: msg=hello
  when: y
```

would fire a warning because `y` would get expanded to `{{ x }}`.
This checks whether a warning is required prior to expansion.

Ensure exit_json returns failed = False

This is required for modules that may return a non-zero `rc` value for a

set.

Adapted unit and integration tests to the new scheme.
Updated raw, shell, script, expect to take `rc` into account.

win_firewall_rule: Implement idempotency, check-mode and diff support (#23162)

- RDP example that matches default RDP rule
- Renamed parameter ''enable'' to ''enabled'' (kept alias)
- Renamed parameter ''profile'' to ''profiles'' (kept alias)

- Make the module idempotent
- Implement check-mode
- Implement diff-mode
- Adapted integration tests

This fixes #18807 and #23455.

reset_connection fixes: #23621 (#25211)

* moved the logging statement

moved the logging statement before the actual action

* added status code check

In the existing implementation when the ssh command fails the command
result is silently discarded. It hides the fact that the disconnection
did not go as expected. Effectively the intended action was not
successful, but the play continues.

* Revert '"added status code check'"

This reverts commit fe2eb2ae4aeb4812fa2f59ccdfabc9efc677e657.

Facts Refresh (2.4 roadmap) (#23012)

Facts Refresh (2.4 roadmap)

This commit implements most of the 2.4 roadmap ''Facts Refresh''
- move facts.py to facts/__init__.py
- move facts Distribution() to its own class
- add a facts/utils.py
- move get_file_content and get_uname_version to facts/utils.py
- move Facts() class from facts/__init__ to facts/facts.py
- mv get_file_lines to facts/utils.py
- mv Ohai()/Facter() class to facts/ohai.py and facter.py
- Start moving fact Hardware() classes to facts/hardware/*.py
- mv HPUX() hardware class to facts/hardware/hpux.py
- move SunOSHardware() fact class to facts/hardware/sunos.py
- move OpenBSDHardware() class to facts/hardware/openbsd.py
- mv FreeBsdHardware() and DragonFlyHardware() to facts/hardware/
- mv NetBSDHardware() to facts/hardware/netbsd.py
- mv Darwin() hardware class to facts/hardware/darwin.py
- pep8/etc cleanups on facts/hardware/*.py
- Mv network facts classes to facts/network/*.py
- mv Virtual fact classes to facts/virtual
- mv Hardware.get_sysctl to facts/sysctl.py:get_sysctl

- Also mv get_uname_version from facts/utils.py -> distribution.py
  since distribution.py is the only thing using it.

- add collector.py with new BaseFactCollector
- add a subclass for AnsibleFactCollector
- hook up dict key munging FactNamespaces
- add some test cases for testing the names of facts
- mv timeout stuff to facts.timeout

- rm ansible_facts()/get_all_facts() etc

- Instead of calling facts.ansible_facts(), fact collection
  api used by setup.py is now to create an AnsibleFactCollector()
  and call it''s collect method.

- replace Facts.get_user_facts with UserFactCollector
- add a ''systems'' facts package, mv UserFactCollector there
- mv get_dns_facts to DnsFactCollector
- mv get_env_facts to EnvFactCollector
- include the timeout length in exception message

- modules and module_utils that use AnsibleFactCollector
  can now theoretically set the ''valid_subsets''

  May be useful for network facts module that currently have
  to reimplement a good chunk of facts.py to get gather_subsets
  to work.

- get_local_facts -> system/LocalFactCollector
- get_date_time -> system/date_time.py
- get_fips_facts -> system/fips.py
- get_caps_facts() -> system/caps.py
- get_apparmor_facts -> system/apparmor.py
- get_selinux_facts -> system/selinux.py
- get_lsb_facts -> system/lsb.py
- get_service_mgr_facts -> system/service_mgr.py
- Facts.is_systemd_managed ->  system/service_mgr.py
- get_pkg_mgr_facts -> system/pkg_mgr.py
- Facts()._get_mount_size_facts() -> facts.utils.get_mount_size()

- add unit test for EnvFactCollector
- add a test case for minimal gather_subsets
- add test case for collect_ids
- Make gather_subset match existing behavior or ''!all''

    If ''gather_subset'' is provided as ''!all'', the existing behavior
    (in 2.2/2.3) is that means ''dont collect any facts except those
    from the Facts() class''. So ''skip everything except
    ''apparmor'', ''caps'', ''date_time'', ''env'', ''fips'', ''local'', ''lsb'',
    ''pkg_mgr'', ''python'', ''selinux'', ''service_mgr'', ''user'', ''platform'', etc.

    The new facts setup was making ''!all'' mean no facts at all, since
    it can add/exclude at a finer granularity. Since that makes more
    sense for the ansible collector, and the set of minimal facts to
    collect is really more up to setup.py to decide we do just that.

    So if setup.py needs to always collect some gather_subset, even
    on !all, setup.py needs to have the that subset added to the
    list it passes as minimal_gather_subset.

    This should fix some intg tests that assume ''!all'' means that
    some facts are still collected (user info and env for example).

    If we want to make setup.py collect a more minimal set, we can do that.

- force facts_dicts.keys() to a list so py3 works
- split fact collector tests to test_collectors.py

- convert Facter(Facts) -> other/facter.py:FacterFactCollector

- add FactCollector.collect_with_namespace()

    regular .collect() will return a dict with the key names
    using the base names (''ip_address'', ''service_mgr'' etc)

    .collect_with_namespace() will return a dict where the key names
    have been transformed with the collectors namespace, if there is
    one. For most, this means a namespace that adds ''ansible_'' to the
    start of the key name.

    For ''FacterFactCollector'', the namespace transforms the key to
    ''facter_*''.

- add test cases for collect_with_namespace

- move all the concrete ''which facts does setup.py'' stuff to setup.py

    The caller of AnsibleFactCollector.from_gather_subset() needs to
    pass in the list of collector classes now.

- update system/setup.py to import all of the fact classes and pass
  in that list.
- split the Distribution fact class up a bit

    extracted the ''distro release'' file handling (ie, linux
    boxes with /etc/release, /etc/os-release etc) into its
    own class.
- extract get_cmdline_facts -> cmdline.py
- extract get_public_ssh_host_keys -> system/ssh_pub_keys.py
- extract get_platform_facts -> system/platform.py

  platform.py may be a good candidate for further splitting.

- rm test for plain Facts() base class
- let the base class for Collector unit tests provide collected_facts

    some Collectors and/or their migrated Facts() subsclasses need
    to look at facts collected by other modules (''ansible_architecture''
    the main one...).

    Collector.collect() has the collected_facts arg for this, so add
    a class variable to BaseFactsTest so we can specify it.

- mv Ohai to other/ohai.py and convert to Collector
- update hardware/*.py to return facts (no side effects)

- mv AnsibleFactCollector to setup.py
- extra collector class gathering to module method in
  facts/__init__.py (collector_classes_from_gather_subset)
- add a CollectorMetaDataCollector collector used to provide
  the ''gather_setup'' fact
- add unit test module for ''setup'' module
  (test/units/modules/system/setup.py)

- Collector init now doesnt need a module, but collect does

    An instance of a FactCollector() isnt tied to a AnsibleModule
    instance, but the collect() method can be, so optionally pass
    in module to FactCollector.collect() (everywhere)

- add a default_collectors for list of default collectors

  import and use it from setup.py module

  eventually, would like to replace this with a plugin loader
  style class finder/loader

- unit tests for module_utils/facts/__init__.py
- add unit tests for ohai facts collector
- remove self.facts side effect on populate() in hardware/sunos.py
- convert OpenBSDHardware() to rm side effects on self.facts
- try to rm some self.facts side effects in Network()

    plumb in collected_facts from populate() where it is needed.

    stop passing collected_facts into Network() [via cached_facts=,
    where it eventually becomes self.facts]

- nothing provides Fact() cached_facts arg now, rm it

    Facts() should be internal only implementation so nothing
    should be using it.

    Of course, now someone will.

- add a Collector.name attr to build a map of name->_fact_ids

    To properly exclude a gather_subset spec like ''!hardware'', we
    need to know that ''hardware'' also means ''devices'', ''dmi'', etc.
    Before, ''!hardware'' would remove the ''hardware'' collector name
    but not ''devices''. Since both would end up in id_collector_map,
    we would still end up with the HardwareCollector in the collector
    list. End result being that ''!hardware'' wouldn''t stop hardware
    from being collected.

    So we need to be able to build that map, so add the Collector.name
    attribute that is the primary name (like ''hardware'') and let
    Collector._fact_ids be the other fact ids that a collector is
    responsible for.

    Construct the aliases_map of Collector.name -> set of _fact_ids
    in fact/__init__.py get_collector_names, and use it when we are
    populating the exclude set.

- refactor of distribution.py

    make the big OS_FAMILY literal a little easier to read
    Also keys can now be any string instead of python literals

    99% sure the test for ''KDE Neon'' was wrong
    I don''t see how/where it should or could get ''Neon'' instead
    of ''KDE Neon'' as provided in os-release NAME=

    Use ''distribution'' string for key to OS_MAP

    ie, we dont need to make it a valid python label anymore so dont.

    move _has_dist_file to module as _file_exists
    easier to mock without mucking with os.path

    mv platform.system() calls to within get_distribution_facts() instead
    of Distribution() init.

- remove _json compat module

    The code in here was to support:

      -a ''json'' python module that was not the standard one included
      with python since 2.6.

      - potentially fallback to simplejson if ''json'' was not available.

    ''json'' is available for all supported python versions now so
    no longer needed.

- mv get_collector_names -> facts.collector
- mv collector_classes_from_gather_subset -> facts.collector
- mv collector tests from test_facts -> test_collector

- Use six''s reduce() in sunos/netbsd hardware facts

- rm extraneous get_uname_version in utils

  only system/distribution.py uses it

- Remove Facts() subclass metaclass usage

  - using fact_id and a platform id for matching collectors

    gut most of Facts() subclasses

    rm Facts() subclasses with weird metaclass

    only add collectors that match the fact_ids and the platform_info
    to the list of collectors used.

    atm, a collectors platform_id will default to ''Generic'', and
    any platform matches ''Generic''

    goal is to select collector classes including matching the
    systems platform in collector.py, instead of relying on
    metaclasses in hardware/*. To finish this, the various
    Facts() subclasses will need to be replaced entirely with
    Collector() subclasses.

    use collector classmethod platform_match() to match the platform

    This lets the particular class decide if it is compatible with
    a given platform_info. platform_info is a dict like obj, so it could be
    expanded in the future.

    Add a default platform_match to BaseFactCollector that matches
    platform_info[''system''] == cls._platform

    They were needed previously to trigger a module
    load on all the collector classes when we import
    facts/hardare so that the Hardware() and related
    classes that used __new__ and find_all_subclasses()
    would work.

    Now that is done in collectors based on platform matching
    at runtime we dont need to do it py module import/parse
    time. So the non empty __init__.pys are no longer needed
    and their is a more flexible mechanism for selection
    platform specific stuff.

    facts/facts.py is no longer used, rm''ed

- if we dont find an implement class for gather spec.. just ignore it.

  Would be useful to add a warn to warn about this case.

- Fix SD-UX typo (should be HP-UX)

- Port fix for #21893 (0 sockets) to this branch

    This readds the change from 8ad182059d5a085e4f8ecfe8ae63bad14a7dc01c

    Solaris fact fix (#24793)

    ensure locale for solaris fact gathering

    fixes issue with locale interfering with proper reading of decimals

- raise exceptions in the air like we just dont care.

    Pretty much ignore any not exit exception in facts
    collection. And add some test cases.

- added new selinux fact to clarify python lib

    the selinux fact is boolean false when the library is not installed,
    a dictionary/hash otherwise, but this is ambigous
    added new fact so we can eventually remove the type dichtomy and normalize it as a dict

    Re-add of devel commit 85c7a7b844bf429fc9cc0ffce5dd9bf05ed47b5a to

Using load_source from PluginLoader is troublesome, it is not guaranteed
a module may be importable at the controller, e.g. if a module depends
on module_utils functions it won''t work, because module_utils is not
in the sys path.
Rather than putting that module dependencies introspection, just
use plain parsing like plugin_docs get_docstring does as we only care
about reading ANSIBLE_METADATA.

on its standalone proposal+PR, let''s just go back to have one
action handler per platform agnostic module.
Those action plugins will inherit from net_base.

Make setting of metadata for crypto backend settable at buildtime

Working on several separate ideas to make ansible work with both
cryptography or pycrypto.  This particular change will let a user
installing ansible change which crypto backend gets encoded in the
metadata (and hence, which backend is required by pkg_resource).

This works with both setup.py and pip::

  ANSIBLE_CRYPTO_BACKEND=cryptography pip install ansible
  ANSIBLE_CRYPTO_BACKEND=cryptography python2 ./setup.py

Note that the code to use cryptography is not yet merged so using
ANSIBLE_CRYPTO_BACKEND is not yet a good idea (as it can lead to not
installing pycrypto and hence the current vault code will fail).

* Implemented dconf module for manipulating and reading the dconf database.

* Fixed remote execution for the dconf module when state=present by wrapping the invocation with dbus-launch (dconf requires a running DBus user session). Updated documentation to mention external module dependencies.

* Fixed remote execution for the dconf module when state=absent by wrapping the invocation with dbus-launch (dconf requires a running DBus user session).

* Updated dconf module implementation to make it more robust:

- Detect running D-Bus session, and reuse that one if possible.
- If detection fails, try launching process via dbus-run-session to avoid
  left-over D-Bus processes.
- As last resort run dbus-launch, and clean-up after the changes have been
  made.
- Updated documentation to mention new dependencies and to be more explicit
  about module limitations.

* Fixed PEP8 errors reported by ansibot in dconf module.

* Updated dconf module implementation:

- Fail early if psutil library is not available on the system.
- Go through all of user''s processes to locate a running D-Bus daemon.
- Test potential D-Bus session bus address before deciding to (re)use it.
- Added a couple of debug statements.
- Updated documentation to include dbus-send as requirement.

* Updated dconf module implementation:

- Simplified module, removing all code for handling dbus-daemon, as discussed in
  a community meeting.
- Module user must ensure that D-Bus user session is available and specified
  either via module parameter or environment variable.
- Updated documentation for the change.

* Updated dconf module implementation:

- Add back ability to detect running D-Bus user session.
- Fail-back to using dbus-run-session if running session could not be detected.

* PEP8 fix for dconf module.

* Updated dconf module implementation:

- Introduce correct examples for Gnome DE.
- Rename existing examples to mark them as Cinnamon-specific.
- Use self.module.get_bin_path instead of custom check for dbus-run-session.
- Fixed typo in method documentation for DconfPreference.reset().

Updates gtm wide ip module to be feature complete (#25502)

This module is used to manage GTM wide ips on a bigip.
Previously, this module only included a small subset of functionality
primarily related to editing a wide ip that already existed. Additionally
it used the SOAP api for its communication. this patch completes the
feature set of wide ips and refactors the code to use the F5 python SDK
and the REST API.

Unit tests are provided. Integration tests can be found here

Fix import for get_exception (#25551)

Fixes #25549

Signed-off-by: Abhijeet Kasurde <akasurde@redhat.com>

# This is the commit message #4:

Try to show original exception info for yaml (and other) errors  (#24468)

* show original exception for yaml (and other) errors

In places where we need to catch a yaml error and raise
an AnsibleError, add the orig yaml exc to the AnsibleError
via the orig_exc arg.

When the AnsibleError is displayed it will now include the
AnsibleError (AnsibleParserError for example) and the type
and message from the original yaml exception.

This provides more detail to the error messages related to
yaml errors.

This also improves errors from dataloader (for example,
previously if a wrong password was used for a vault encrypted
yaml file, the error was very vague and suggested yaml errors,
but now the message includes the original exception from vault
indicating the password was incorrect or missing).

Add a text note to playbook helper asserts. For playbook
syntax/layout errors that aren''t yaml errors, but errors
indicating invalid data structures for a playbook/task/role/block,
we now include some info about where the assert was and
why it was raised.

In places we raise an AnsibleParserError in an except
clause, pass the original exception to AnsibleParserError via
orig_exc arg.

Make assorted error messages a little more specific (like
the playbook helper load methods)

* Revert '"Include the original YAML error in syntax error messages'"

Fix redis cache for python3

According to the redis-py docs, zrank will return the 0 based index for
the value in the sorted set.  So the logic here wasn''t right to begin
with (It just means that a value at the 0-th position would never show

Add UUID, label and id links to devices when building facts (#25448)

At present, the available facts around block devices are not sufficient to be able to find stable names guaranteed to work across reboots, or to identify block devices by label (UUID, etc).

This patch provides a list of observed links for each device. It relies on functionality specific to Linux (as does the existing sysfs-based code which it extends), but should not cause issues on other platforms.

Moreover, it prevents virtual devices from being excluded, and links such devices to the physical devices to which they are attached.

- Fix productId implementation (was not working)
- Ensure that we are not changing anything that is not mandatory (hostName, orgName, fullName)

[cloud] Route53 Avoid throttling errors and unnecessary processing when checking rrsets. (#22104)

The boto Route53 get_all_rrsets method will return the record set
matching the name, type, and identifier specified, followed by ALL
subsequent sets in alphabetical order based on name. If the specified
set does not exist, the method will still return all the sets that
_would_ have come after it. Searching through sets we know will not
match is not just a waste of resources but, more importantly, often
triggers AWS API throttling when used on zones with large numbers of
records.

[cloud] iam_cert return arn and allow use with ansible vault (#20787)

* iam_cert.py Fix duplicate certificate detection with included chains.

The iam_cert module would fail to detect certificates as duplicates
if the certificate body included the authority chain directly.

This commit fixes the problem by checking if a given certificate
matches the start of the data returned by AWS, since in all cases
where they would match the certificate will come first.

* iam_cert.py Return certificate ARN in all success cases.

When uploading certificates or interacting with IAM, the certificate ARN
is needed for other operations with AWS such as provisioning elastic load
balancers.

This commit returns the certificate ARN in all success cases, which allows
it to be used to idempotently provision other Amazon services depending on
it (ELBs being an immediate example).

[cloud] New module ec2_vpc_endpoint_facts for AWS EC2 VPC Endpoints (#20211)

* Remove max_items and next_token from vpc_endpoint_facts

max_items and next_token should be a module concern, not
a caller concern. It would be very difficult for a module
consumer to use next_token properly, whereas it''s easy for
the module to handle it.

"block all SSH connections for VCS, for usabililty and security

If we allow SSH, then we''d have to manage known_hosts.

All VCS and submodule URLs should use HTTPS.  SSH URLs have security vulns:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/08/15/git-vulnerability-with-submodules/
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/08/13/ssh_flaw_in_git_mercurial_svn/
CVE-2017-1000117

I did a manual scan of the setup on jenkins.debian.net to see if I could
find any suspicious URLs.  Looks good so far.  This is what I used:

find . -type f -print0 |xargs -0 grep -Eo ''ssh[:+][svn/]+...................''
find . -type f -print0 |xargs -0 grep -Eo ''ssh://-[^ '"]+''

Also, some ssh://_ URLs in submodules might still work, because of the URL
rewriting in fdbfb4d1.  But https://-oProxyCommand=pwnme does not really do
anything, unlike ssh://-oProxyCommand=pwnme

"update: strip EXIF data from all JPEGs

EXIF data can be abused to exploit systems a lot easier than the JPEG image
data can.  The F-Droid ecosystem does not use the EXIF data, so keep things
safe and strip it all away.  There is a chance that some images might rely
on the rotation to be set by EXIF, but I think having a safe system is more
important.

If needed, only the rotation data could be saved.  But that then makes it
hard to tell which images have been stripped.  This way, if there is no
EXIF, it has been stripped.  And if there is EXIF data, then it is suspect.

https://threatpost.com/google-shuts-down-potentially-massive-android-bug/120393/
https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/07/malware-hidden-inside-jpg-exif-headers.html

The big downside of this is that it decompresses and recompresses the
image data.  That should be replaced by a technique from jhead,
exiftool, ObscuraCam, etc. that only strips the metadata.

"[3.5] bpo-32981: Fix catastrophic backtracking vulns (GH-5955)

* Prevent low-grade poplib REDOS (CVE-2018-1060)

The regex to test a mail server''s timestamp is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking on long evil responses from the server.

Happily, the maximum length of malicious inputs is 2K thanks
to a limit introduced in the fix for CVE-2013-1752.

A 2KB evil response from the mail server would result in small slowdowns
(milliseconds vs. microseconds) accumulated over many apop calls.
This is a potential DOS vector via accumulated slowdowns.

Replace it with a similar non-vulnerable regex.

The new regex is RFC compliant.
The old regex was non-compliant in edge cases.

* Prevent difflib REDOS (CVE-2018-1061)

The default regex for IS_LINE_JUNK is susceptible to
catastrophic backtracking.
This is a potential DOS vector.

Replace it with an equivalent non-vulnerable regex.

Also introduce unit and REDOS tests for difflib.

"pmb: adjust to distcc 3.3 and wrap it with sshd

Overview:
Since Alpine updated to distcc 3.3 last week, pmbootstrap wasn''t able to use
distcc for cross compilation anymore. It always falled back to running the
compiler in QEMU (which works, but is a lot slower). The reason for that is,
that distcc requires all compilers that are being used in a whitelist now.

This partially fixes CVE-2004-2687 in distccd, which allowed trivial remote
code execution by any process connecting to the distccd server. We only run
distccd on localhost, but still this can be used for privilege escalation of
sandboxed processes running on the host system (not part of pmbootstrap
chroots).

Because the CVE is only partially fixed (see the comment in
`pmb/chroot/distccd.py` for details), we make sure that only the building
chroots can talk to the distcc server by running distcc over ssh.

Details:
* Completely refactored `pmb/chroot/distccd.py` to run distcc over ssh
  * Store the running distcc server''s arguments as JSON now, not as INI
* Make debugging distcc issues easy:
  * Set DISTCC_BACKOFF_PERIOD=0, so the distcc client will not ignore the
    server after errors happened (this masks the original error!)
  * New pmbootstrap parameters:
    * `--distcc-nofallback`: avoids falling back to compiling with QEMU and not
	   throwing an error
	* `--ccache-disable`: avoid ccache (when the compiler output is cached,
	  distcc does not get used)
  * `--verbose` prints verbose output of the distcc too
  * New test case, that uses the new pmbootstrap parameters to force
	compilation through distcc, and shows the output of distcc and distccd in
	verbose mode on error (as well as the log of sshd)
